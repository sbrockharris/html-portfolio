<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Not one to talk about myself. Especially after a long shift as a nurse.</p> 
<p>I love what I'm learning here. I'm excited to sit down and practice and tinker with 
  things until they word in the desired way.</p>   
<p>I desperately want a career change.</p>  
<p>You can fix code. You can't fix people. I've spent a decade trying. 
  It's time for something new.</p>
